  <h1><center>How to prepare fried rice</center></h1>
  <h2>Ingredients </h2>
  <p> 
  <ul>
    <li>3¾ cups (750g) long grain parboiled rice</li>
    <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    <li>Chicken (whole chicken or chicken drumsticks)</li>
    <li>100g cow liver</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Nigerian curry powder (NOT Indian Curry)</li>
    <li>½ cup green beans</li>
    <li>3 carrots</li>
    <li>3 onions</li>
    <li>3 stock/boullion cubes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon thyme</li> 
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  
 
  <ol>
    <li>Wash all the vegetables to be used in cooking the fried rice</li>
    <li>Scrape and cut the carrots into tiny cubes.</li>
    <li> Cut the green beans into small pieces of about 0.7cm long.</li>
    <li>Soak these 2 vegetables separately in hot water for about 5 minutes and drain.</li>
    <li>Cut 1 bulb of onion. Set all these aside.</li>
    <li>Prepare the liver and chicken</li>
    <li>Prepare the liver and chicken</li>
    <li>Cut the whole chicken into pieces and cook with the Knorr cubes, thyme and 2 bulbs of onions (chopped).</li>
    <li>When done, grill in an oven or deepfry with vegetable oil</li>
    </ol>
  <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
   <ol> <li>Parboil the rice using the method detailed in parboiling rice for cooking fried rice.</li>
    <li>Rinse the parboiled rice with cold water and put in a sieve so all the water drains out</li>
    <li>Pour the chicken stock into a sieve to remove all traces of onions, thyme etc used in cooking the chicken.</li>
    <li>Pour the stock into a pot and set to boil.</li>
    <li> Once the water boils, add the parboiled rice.</li>
    <li>Also, add 1 tablespoon of plain yellow curry powder, then add salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Stir the contents; cover the pot and leave to cook on medium heat.</li>
    <li>Once the water has dried up, the rice should be cooked perfectly.</li>
    <li>Now, transfer the rice to a casserole dish or another pot to help cool it down quickly.</li>
    <li>Again, this is essential to keep the grains from sticking to each other. If left in the original hot pot, the rice will continue to cook and eventually stick together.</li>
    <li>At this point, it is advisable to divide the vegetables into say 4, 5 or even 6 equal parts</li>
    <li>The rice will be fried in batches so this number depends on the quantity of rice you can comfortably fry in the pan or pot.</li>
    <li>Also, divide the cooked rice and the diced cow liver into the same number of equal parts.</li>
    <li>Now pour a small amount of vegetable oil into a frying pan. This quantity of oil should be such that it would be absorbed by 1 part of the cooked rice and 1 part each of the vegetables.</li>
    <li>When the oil is hot, add 1 part of diced onions and stir for 10 seconds, followed by 1 part of diced cow liver, one part each of the diced vegetables, then 1 part of cooked rice.</li>
    <li>Add more salt if necessary.</li>
    <li>More curry powder may also be added at this stage if you need to touch up on the colour.</li> 
    <li>Stir till all the ingredients have mixed well and transfer to a dry pot.</li> 
    <li>Repeat this for the remaining batches of the ingredients.</li>
  </ol>
